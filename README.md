# liri-node-app
This is a CLI app that leverages multiple APIs to deliver information on songs, concerts, and movies.

Simply make your query from the root folder like so:

"node liri.js "

followed by the type of search you would like to make...
"spotify-this-song " "concert-this " "movie-this "

followed by the song movie or concert you would like to search for...
"Dancing Queen" "The Beatles" "The Godfather"

Hit enter and see the magic!

I chose not to have the APIs return default data when the user doesn't enter a field because I think it's more confusing for the user.
